# Bejeweled_Blitz
A match-three puzzle game akin to Bejeweled Blitz, featuring the iconic gem-matching mechanics and timed games

## Implementation
* This was my first semester project and its goal was to become familiar with the basics of programming
* The graphics were implemented with just the window.h library and game logic just used simple functional programming paradigm concepts

## Functionality
* At the starting screen press enter to start the game and try to score as much as you can in 120 seconds.
* Use the arrow keys to move around the red cursor and press enter to SELECT a gem for swapping (turning the cursor blue) then press an arrow key to specify the direction of the swap.
* If the swap is valid it takes place otherwise the cursor instantly becomes red and it can move around again.
  
## Run Locally
* Download the "Bejeweled-Blitz-Files" folder and run the bejeweledBlitz.exe file in this folder to play the game
* The "Project.cpp" and the "help.h" files contain the source code
